          <h2>Procedure</h2>
          <p>
            1. We made a Pd file that continuously generates chord progressions
            capable of key modulations. Chords chosen through weighted
            probability tables reflect the user's emotions. Drum machine music
            is generated using audio sampled from Ableton Live.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. After soldering jumper cables onto a pulse sensor, we translated
            it with an ADC on a Raspberry Pi and used Calculus to determine a
            user's heartbeat with Python. We set up the sensor on an Arduino and
            coded a BPM calculator with a button as a second option.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. We coded a GUI for users to submit a photo on their local machine
            and a facial recognition software with DeepFace analysis their
            emotion. We used Juypter Notebook to run the AI and UI.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Finally, Python sockets continuously update and send information
            to Pd to generate music on the user's local machine through IP.
          </p>
          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          <p>
            Through our own experiences playing music, we found a gap when it
            came to personalizationâ€” yet feeling a close bond to music is
            essential to enjoying it. This inspired us to develop a project that
            can provide a stronger foundation for that bond, particularly in
            people new to playing music, such as children. Once forged, the
            connection motivates people to invest time in music and enjoy what
            they produce!
